        <h1>The 75% Attendance Rule: A Broken Compass for Modern Education</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Does forcing students into classrooms prepare them for the future, or hold them back?</strong></p>
        
        <p><em>The system checks attendance but misses the point of education: growth, exploration, and real learning.</em></p>
        
        <p>In most educational institutions, the 75% attendance rule is treated as a sacred mandate. The logic? Higher attendance leads to better education. But does sitting in a classroom for hours truly equip students to thrive in todayâ€™s world?</p>
        
        <p>The answer lies in understanding two types of students:  
        ðŸ”¹ **Ambitious learners** who innovate, explore, and work on real-world skills.  
        ðŸ”¹ **Unfocused learners** who are yet to discover their path.  
        </p>

            <div class="caption">Figure 1: The two pathsâ€”Ambition and Exploration vs Compulsion.</div>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>The Harmful Impact on Ambitious Students</strong></p>
        
        <p>Ambitious students often want to build projects, pursue internships, or innovate outside the classroom. However, the 75% rule shackles their potential. Instead of giving them freedom to learn skills beyond textbooks, they are forced to spend hours in traditional settings where engagement is minimal.</p>
        
        <p>Education systems must recognize that ambition thrives on curiosity, not compulsion. Forcing attendance kills passion, limits exploration, and leaves ambitious students frustrated.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Unfocused Students: A Missed Opportunity</strong></p>

        <p>For those still figuring out their goals, mandatory attendance doesnâ€™t solve the real problem. Instead of guidance, mentorship, or inspiration, they get coercion.  
        ðŸ”¹ What they truly need:  
        âœ… Real-world exposure through stories of success.  
        âœ… Meaningful mentorship.  
        âœ… Freedom to explore at their own pace.  
        </p>

        <p>Forcing attendance without addressing their deeper needs leaves these students disengaged and uninspired.</p>

            <div class="caption">Figure 2: Compulsion frustrates both ambitious and unfocused students.</div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Why Does the Rule Exist?</strong></p>
        
        <p>ðŸ”¹ **For parents**: Attendance offers an illusion of productivity. It feels safeâ€”if their child is in class, they must be learning.  
        ðŸ”¹ **For institutions**: It guarantees revenue and standardized metrics, regardless of whether students are truly gaining value.  
        </p>
        
        <p>In truth, this rule creates a broken system that measures compliance over capability.</p>

        <p><strong>The Real Solution: Freedom and Guidance</strong></p>
        
        <p>What if we redefined education to truly serve students? Hereâ€™s what could work:  
        ðŸ”¹ Allow ambitious students time to explore, experiment, and innovate.  
        ðŸ”¹ Support unfocused students with mentorship, success stories, and role models to inspire them.  
        ðŸ”¹ Focus on outcomesâ€”skills, growth, and explorationâ€”not just attendance.  
        </p>
        
        <div class="image">

            <div class="caption">Figure 3: Learning thrives when students are given purpose and freedom.</div>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Redefining Success in Education</strong></p>

        <p>The 75% rule belongs to an old system where presence mattered more than progress. Modern education demands a shift:  
        ðŸ”¹ From **checking boxes** to creating opportunities.  
        ðŸ”¹ From **attendance** to engagement and inspiration.  
        </p>

        <p>When education prioritizes growth and curiosity over compulsion, every studentâ€”whether ambitious or searchingâ€”will thrive.</p>

        <p><strong>Itâ€™s time to ask: Are we preparing students for attendance or for success?</strong></p>
